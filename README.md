## About

This API was made to help students study for upcoming tests. In it, you can contribute by adding an old exam you have from a specific teacher of a specific subject making it public to others. In addition to sending tests, one can also look for them in our database, searching by teacher or subject.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Create a root project folder named repoprovas for semantics
```sh
mkdir repoprovas
```
2. Clone the front-end repo (within the /repoprovas folder)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/leandrodcs/repo-provas-front.git
```
3. Install NPM packages for the front-end repo
```sh
npm install
```
4. Clone the back-end repo (within the /repoprovas folder)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/leandrodcs/repo-provas-back.git
```
5. Install NPM packages for the back-end repo
```sh
npm install
```
6. Create a database using the command below
```sh
CREATE DATABASE repoprovas
```
7. Inside the created database, create tables using the dump included in the back-end repo <a href="https://github.com/leandrodcs/repo-provas-back/blob/main/dump.sql">here</a>.

8. Connect to the created database using the .env.example included in the back-end repo <a href="https://github.com/leandrodcs/repo-provas-back/blob/main/.env.example">here</a>, to make it easy, name your .env file like so ".env.dev".

### Running

1. On the back-end repo run the server connected to the database you just created using the following command.
```sh
npm run dev
```
2. Now on the fron-end repo use the same command you just used on step 8 and you should be good.
